# Data Manipulation
For the first activity,i applied the filter function across the headers for both the job type and salary column to show employees working as freelancers earning higher than $10,000.I also did split the full name into first name and last name for each of the employee by inserting an extra column  using the text_to_column function.Then lastly,i used the conditional formatting to highlight employees whose name starts with an E in yellow and also the employee with the highest salary in green and the lowest salary in red.
